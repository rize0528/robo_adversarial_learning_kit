# Issue #5 Analysis: Loss Functions

## Problem Analysis
Issue #5 focuses on creating comprehensive loss functions for adversarial patch generation targeting Vision-Language Models. This involves both targeted attacks (forcing specific misclassifications) and non-targeted attacks (object omission/suppression), with a pluggable interface for extensibility.

## Work Streams

### Stream A: Core Loss Function Framework
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: 
- `src/losses/base.py`
- `src/losses/__init__.py`
- `src/losses/factory.py`
- `tests/test_loss_base.py`

**Scope**: 
- Abstract LossFunction base class with common interface
- Loss function factory for easy configuration  
- Core infrastructure for gradient computation and batch processing
- GPU optimization setup with PyTorch tensors
- Base regularization framework (patch smoothness, total variation)

**Dependencies**: Task #3 completed âœ… (VLM Integration Framework available)

### Stream B: Attack-Specific Loss Implementations
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Files**:
- `src/losses/targeted.py`
- `src/losses/non_targeted.py`
- `src/losses/composite.py`
- `tests/test_targeted_loss.py`
- `tests/test_non_targeted_loss.py`
- `tests/test_composite_loss.py`

**Scope**:
- TargetedLoss for forcing specific model outputs
- NonTargetedLoss for general object suppression
- Confidence-based loss variants with thresholds
- Margin-based losses for robust attacks
- Loss function composition for multi-objective attacks
- Gradient smoothing implementation

**Dependencies**: Requires Stream A completion (base framework)

## Coordination Rules

1. **Stream A must complete first** - provides loss function framework
2. **Stream B depends on A** - needs base classes and infrastructure  
3. **Parallel capability** - task is marked as parallel: true in frontmatter
4. **VLM Integration** - both streams use existing VLM framework from Task #3
5. **Testing integration** - comprehensive testing across both streams

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Stream A: Complete loss function framework with base classes and factory
- [ ] Stream B: All attack-specific loss implementations working
- [ ] Integration: Pluggable interface allows easy experimentation
- [ ] Performance: GPU-optimized computation with batch processing
- [ ] Testing: All loss function variants tested and validated

## Next Steps

1. Start with Stream A (Core Loss Function Framework)
2. Once A completes, launch Stream B (Attack-Specific Loss Implementations)
3. Integrate and test complete loss function system
4. Validate performance with VLM integration from Task #3
