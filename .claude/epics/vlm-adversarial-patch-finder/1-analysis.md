# Issue #1 Analysis: Epic Coordination

## Problem Analysis
Issue #1 is the main epic for "VLM Adversarial Patch Finder" - a comprehensive AI security demonstration system. This epic coordinates 10 sub-tasks (#2-#11) that need to be executed in the correct dependency order.

## Work Streams

### Stream A: Foundation Setup (Immediate Start)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: 
- `requirements.txt`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/models/`
- `tests/test_models.py`
- `config/`

**Scope**: 
- Environment & Model Setup (Issue #3)
- Basic VLM loading and inference verification
- Python environment and dependency management
- Configuration files setup

**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

### Stream B: Core Algorithm Development (Dependent)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Files**:
- `src/optimization/`
- `src/losses/`
- `src/patch_generator/`
- `tests/test_optimization.py`

**Scope**:
- Patch Optimization Core (Issue #11)
- Loss Functions (Issue #5) 
- Patch Generation Script (Issue #7)
- Core adversarial optimization algorithms

**Dependencies**: Requires Stream A completion (model loading)

### Stream C: Integration & UI (Parallel with B)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**:
- `src/camera/`
- `src/demo/`
- `src/presets/`
- `tests/test_integration.py`

**Scope**:
- Camera Integration (Issue #8)
- Demo Interface (Issue #2)  
- Exhibition Presets (Issue #4)
- User interface and hardware integration

**Dependencies**: Requires Stream A completion (model loading)

## Coordination Rules

1. **Stream A must complete first** - provides foundation for B and C
2. **Streams B and C can run in parallel** after A completes
3. **Final integration** requires all streams to coordinate
4. **Testing & Documentation** (Issues #6, #9, #10) happen after core implementation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Stream A: Model loads successfully and basic inference works
- [ ] Stream B: Adversarial patches generate with >70% attack success rate
- [ ] Stream C: Live camera feed processes and UI displays results
- [ ] Integration: End-to-end demo runs reliably for 8+ hours

## Next Steps

1. Start with Stream A (Foundation Setup) 
2. Once A completes, launch Streams B and C in parallel
3. Coordinate integration when both B and C are complete
4. Execute final testing and documentation phase
