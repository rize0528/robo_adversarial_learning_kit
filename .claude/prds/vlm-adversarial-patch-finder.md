# PRD: VLM Adversarial Patch Finder

## Executive Summary

The VLM Adversarial Patch Finder is an AI robot model security demonstration system that exposes critical vulnerabilities in vision-language models used in robotics applications. The system operates in two distinct modes: **adversarial patch generation mode** for creating attack patterns, and **inference mode** for demonstrating real-time security breaches.

This system serves as a flagship security demonstration for AI robotics exhibitions, specifically designed to highlight the urgent need for robust AI model security in robot deployments. The primary goal is to educate industry stakeholders about AI model vulnerabilities and promote security-first thinking in robot AI development.

## Problem Statement

### Critical AI Model Security Gap in Robotics

The robotics industry is experiencing rapid adoption of AI models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), without adequate consideration of model security implications. Current AI robotics discussions focus heavily on capabilities and performance while largely ignoring security vulnerabilities:

- **AI Model Blindness**: Industry assumes AI models are inherently secure and reliable
- **Attack Vector Ignorance**: Stakeholders are unaware that simple printed patches can completely compromise robot AI systems
- **Security vs Performance Trade-off**: No understanding of how security measures might impact AI model performance
- **Regulatory Preparation Gap**: Industry unprepared for emerging AI safety and security regulations
- **Trust and Liability Issues**: Lack of frameworks for assessing AI model reliability in critical applications

### Why AI Robot Model Security Matters Now

- **AI-First Robotics Era**: Modern robots are increasingly dependent on AI models for core functionality
- **Physical World Consequences**: Unlike software attacks, compromised robot AI can cause physical harm
- **Regulatory Pressure**: Governments worldwide developing AI safety and security requirements
- **Market Maturity**: Industry needs to move beyond "AI magic" to systematic security assessment
- **Competitive Differentiation**: Security-conscious AI development becomes key differentiator

### Target Attack Scenarios

The system will demonstrate these attack patterns:
- **Safety System Bypass**: AI model fails to detect humans or obstacles, compromising robot safety systems
- **Mission-Critical Failure**: Robot AI completely misinterprets operational environment, leading to task failure
