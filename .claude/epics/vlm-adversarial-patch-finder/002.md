# Task: Data Pipeline

## Description
Create a robust data pipeline for loading and preprocessing training images used in adversarial patch generation. Implement utilities for image loading, preprocessing operations (resize, normalize), and PyTorch data loaders to support the optimization process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Image loading utilities implemented for common formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- [ ] Image preprocessing pipeline with resize and normalization functions
- [ ] PyTorch Dataset class for adversarial training data
- [ ] PyTorch DataLoader configured with appropriate batch size and workers
- [ ] Support for both single images and batch processing
- [ ] Data augmentation capabilities for training robustness
- [ ] Memory-efficient loading for large datasets

## Technical Details
- Implement image loading with PIL/OpenCV integration
- Create preprocessing functions for VLM input requirements (resize, normalize, tensor conversion)
- Build custom PyTorch Dataset class that handles image paths and targets
- Configure DataLoader with proper batching, shuffling, and multiprocessing
- Add data augmentation options (rotation, brightness, contrast)
- Key files/locations: `src/data/dataset.py`, `src/data/preprocessing.py`, `tests/test_data_pipeline.py`

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Environment & Model Setup must be completed
- [ ] Sample image dataset for testing
- [ ] PyTorch and torchvision installed (from Task 001)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 6
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented
- [ ] Tests written and passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Code reviewed
