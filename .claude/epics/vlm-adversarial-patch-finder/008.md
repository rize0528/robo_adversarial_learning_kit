# Task: Exhibition Presets - Configure 3 scenarios (healthcare/manufacturing/autonomous)

## Description
Create three comprehensive demonstration scenarios for different industry verticals, each showcasing specific adversarial patch vulnerabilities in vision-language models. These presets will serve as ready-to-use configurations for exhibitions, presentations, and educational demonstrations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Healthcare robot scenario with medical equipment recognition attacks
- [ ] Manufacturing QC scenario with defect detection bypass attacks
- [ ] Autonomous vehicle scenario with traffic sign misclassification attacks
- [ ] Pre-configured patch sets optimized for each scenario domain
- [ ] Detailed security impact explanations with real-world consequences
- [ ] Interactive guided tours through each attack demonstration
- [ ] Customizable severity levels from proof-of-concept to critical impact
- [ ] Export capabilities for scenario reports and findings documentation

## Technical Details
- Healthcare: Target medical imaging, patient monitoring, surgical robotics
- Manufacturing: Focus on quality control, safety inspection, production line automation
- Autonomous: Emphasize traffic signs, pedestrian detection, obstacle recognition
- Create scenario-specific VLM prompts and expected behaviors
- Implement domain-specific evaluation metrics and success criteria
- Develop contextual explanations linking technical attacks to business impact
- Include regulatory compliance considerations for each industry vertical

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 005: Patch generation algorithms must be complete and tested
- [ ] Task 007: Demo interface must be operational for scenario deployment
- [ ] Industry-specific test datasets and validation imagery
- [ ] Domain expert consultation for realistic scenario development

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with configurable scenario parameters
- [ ] Tests written and passing for all three scenario configurations
- [ ] Documentation updated with scenario setup and customization guides
- [ ] Code reviewed for educational value and technical accuracy
- [ ] Scenarios validated with domain experts for realism and impact
- [ ] Exhibition-ready deployment package created with all assets
