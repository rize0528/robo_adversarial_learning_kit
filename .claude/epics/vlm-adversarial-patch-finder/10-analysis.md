# Issue #10 Analysis: Data Pipeline

## Problem Analysis
Issue #10 focuses on creating a robust data pipeline for adversarial patch generation. This involves image loading utilities, preprocessing operations, PyTorch dataset/dataloader implementation, and data augmentation capabilities.

## Work Streams

### Stream A: Image Processing Foundation
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: 
- `src/data/preprocessing.py`
- `src/utils/image_utils.py` (if extending existing)
- `tests/test_preprocessing.py`
- Sample test images

**Scope**: 
- Image loading utilities for common formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Image preprocessing pipeline (resize, normalize, tensor conversion)
- VLM-specific preprocessing requirements
- Basic image processing utilities and helpers
- Data augmentation capabilities (rotation, brightness, contrast)

**Dependencies**: Task #3 completed âœ… (Environment & Model Setup)

### Stream B: Dataset & DataLoader Implementation
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Files**:
- `src/data/dataset.py`
- `tests/test_data_pipeline.py`
- `tests/test_dataset.py`

**Scope**:
- Custom PyTorch Dataset class for adversarial training data
- DataLoader configuration with proper batching and multiprocessing
- Support for both single images and batch processing
- Memory-efficient loading for large datasets
- Integration with preprocessing pipeline from Stream A

**Dependencies**: Requires Stream A completion (preprocessing pipeline)

## Coordination Rules

1. **Stream A must complete first** - provides image processing foundation
2. **Stream B depends on A** - needs preprocessing pipeline for dataset implementation
3. **Sequential execution** - this is marked as non-parallel in the task definition
4. **Memory efficiency** - both streams must consider memory constraints
5. **Testing integration** - comprehensive testing across both components

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Stream A: Image processing and augmentation pipeline working
- [ ] Stream B: PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader functional
- [ ] Integration: Complete data pipeline from raw images to model input
- [ ] Performance: Memory-efficient processing of image batches
- [ ] Testing: All data pipeline components tested and verified

## Next Steps

1. Start with Stream A (Image Processing Foundation)
2. Once A completes, launch Stream B (Dataset & DataLoader Implementation)  
3. Integrate and test complete data pipeline
4. Verify all acceptance criteria are met with sample dataset
