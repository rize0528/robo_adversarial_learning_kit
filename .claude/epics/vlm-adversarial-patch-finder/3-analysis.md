# Issue #3 Analysis: Environment & Model Setup

## Problem Analysis
Issue #3 focuses on setting up the foundational environment and VLM infrastructure for the adversarial patch generation system. This involves Python environment setup, dependency installation, and VLM model loading verification.

## Work Streams

### Stream A: Environment & Dependencies
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: 
- `requirements.txt`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `config/model_config.yaml`
- `tests/test_environment.py`

**Scope**: 
- Python environment setup with all dependencies
- PyTorch with CUDA support (if available)
- HuggingFace Transformers configuration
- OpenCV installation for image processing
- Configuration file setup

**Dependencies**: None - can start immediately

### Stream B: VLM Model Integration
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Files**:
- `src/models/vlm_loader.py`
- `src/models/gemma_vlm.py`
- `tests/test_model_setup.py`
- `tests/test_inference.py`

**Scope**:
- Gemma-3 4B model loading implementation
- Basic inference pipeline setup
- Model verification and testing
- HuggingFace Hub integration
- Error handling and fallbacks

**Dependencies**: Requires Stream A completion (environment must be ready)

## Coordination Rules

1. **Stream A must complete first** - provides foundation Python environment
2. **Stream B depends on A** - needs working Python environment with dependencies
3. **Sequential execution** - this is not a parallel task per the task definition
4. **Testing integration** - both streams contribute to comprehensive testing

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Stream A: Python environment with all dependencies working
- [ ] Stream B: Gemma-3 4B model loads and performs basic inference
- [ ] Integration: All tests pass including inference verification
- [ ] Verification: Model outputs are correct for sample images

## Next Steps

1. Start with Stream A (Environment & Dependencies)
2. Once A completes, launch Stream B (VLM Model Integration)
3. Integrate and test complete pipeline
4. Verify all acceptance criteria are met
