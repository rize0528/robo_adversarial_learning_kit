# Stream B: Dataset & DataLoader Implementation

## Scope
PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader implementation for adversarial patch generation training. This includes custom Dataset class for adversarial training data, DataLoader configuration with proper batching and multiprocessing, support for single images and batch processing, and memory-efficient loading integration.

## Files
- `src/data/dataset.py`
- `tests/test_data_pipeline.py`
- `tests/test_dataset.py`

## Progress
- Stream A (Image Processing Foundation) completed successfully
- Starting Dataset & DataLoader implementation
- Focus on creating robust PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader classes
