**Stream:** Core Loss Function Framework (Stream A)  
**Issue:** #5 - Loss Functions  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-08

## Completed Work

### ✅ Abstract LossFunction Base Class (`src/losses/base.py`)
- Created comprehensive abstract `LossFunction` base class with common interface
- Implemented GPU optimization with automatic device and dtype handling 
- Added gradient clipping and reduction mode support
- Designed extensible architecture for subclass implementations
- Included comprehensive error handling and validation

### ✅ Loss Function Factory (`src/losses/factory.py`)
- Implemented factory pattern for easy loss function configuration and instantiation
- Added registration system for custom loss functions and regularization terms
- Integrated YAML configuration support with defaults and overrides
- Provided convenience functions and global factory instance
- Included configuration save/load functionality

### ✅ GPU Optimization Setup
- PyTorch tensor handling with automatic device detection
- Efficient memory management and tensor movement
- Support for multiple data types (float16, float32, bfloat16)
- CUDA availability detection and fallback to CPU

### ✅ Base Regularization Framework
- **Total Variation Loss**: Patch smoothness regularization using spatial gradients
- **Smoothness Penalty**: L2 smoothness using Laplacian kernel convolution
- Abstract `RegularizationTerm` base class for extensible regularization
- Configurable weighting and combination of multiple regularization terms

### ✅ Batch Processing Capabilities  
- `BatchLossFunction` class for optimized batch processing

- Unit tests for individual components (config, regularization, base classes)
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- GPU/CPU compatibility testing
- Mock implementations for testing abstract classes
- Edge case and error condition validation

## Key Technical Features Implemented

### 1. Abstract Base Architecture
```python
class LossFunction(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def compute_loss(self, model_outputs, patch, targets=None, **kwargs):
        pass
    
    def forward(self, model_outputs, patch, targets=None, **kwargs):
        # Handles device placement, regularization, reduction
```

### 2. Factory Pattern Integration
```python
factory = LossFactory()
factory.register_loss_function("custom_loss", CustomLossClass)
loss_fn = factory.create_loss_function("custom_loss", add_regularization=True)
```

### 3. GPU Optimization
- Automatic tensor device placement and dtype conversion

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files:
- `src/losses/__init__.py` - Package initialization with exports
- `src/losses/base.py` - Abstract base classes and regularization terms
- `src/losses/factory.py` - Factory pattern implementation
- `tests/test_loss_base.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `.claude/epics/vlm-adversarial-patch-finder/updates/5/stream-A.md` - This progress file

### Directory Structure:

├── base.py
└── factory.py

└── test_loss_base.py
```

## API Examples

### Basic Usage:
```python
from src.losses import LossFactory, LossConfig

# Create factory and register loss function
factory = LossFactory()
factory.register_loss_function("my_loss", MyLossClass)

# Create configured loss function
loss_fn = factory.create_loss_function("my_loss", add_regularization=True)

# Use in training
result = loss_fn(model_outputs, patch, targets)
total_loss = result["total_loss"]
total_loss.backward()
```

### Advanced Configuration:
```python
# Custom configuration
config = LossConfig(
    device="cuda",
    dtype=torch.float16,
    regularization_weight=1e-3,
    gradient_clipping=1.0
)

loss_fn = MyLossFunction(config)
loss_fn.add_regularization(TotalVariationLoss(weight=1e-4))
```

## Acceptance Criteria Status

**All Stream A acceptance criteria completed:**

- ✅ Abstract LossFunction base class created
- ✅ Loss function factory implemented  
- ✅ GPU optimization setup with PyTorch
- ✅ Base regularization framework implemented
- ✅ Batch processing support added
- ✅ Comprehensive tests written and passing

## Ready for Next Stream

The core loss function framework is complete and ready for Stream B (Attack-Specific Loss Implementations). The abstract base classes, factory pattern, and regularization framework provide a solid foundation for implementing:

- Targeted attack losses (forcing specific misclassifications)
- Non-targeted attack losses (object omission/suppression)  
- Confidence-based loss variants
- Multi-objective loss composition

Stream B can now build specific loss function implementations on top of this proven foundation.

## Performance Notes

- All operations optimized for PyTorch tensors and GPU computation
- Efficient memory management with device-aware tensor handling
- Minimal computational overhead in base framework
- Scalable architecture supporting complex loss function compositions
