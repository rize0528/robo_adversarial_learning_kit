# Stream B: Attack-Specific Loss Implementations

## Scope
Attack-specific loss function implementations building on the core framework from Stream A. This includes TargetedLoss for forcing specific model outputs, NonTargetedLoss for object suppression, confidence-based variants, margin-based losses, and multi-objective attack composition.

## Files
- `src/losses/targeted.py`
- `src/losses/non_targeted.py`
- `src/losses/composite.py`
- `tests/test_targeted_loss.py`
- `tests/test_non_targeted_loss.py`
- `tests/test_composite_loss.py`

## Progress
- Stream A (Core Loss Function Framework) completed successfully
- Starting attack-specific loss implementations
- Focus on creating comprehensive attack strategies for VLM adversarial patches
