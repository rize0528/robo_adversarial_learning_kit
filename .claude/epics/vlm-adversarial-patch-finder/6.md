# Task: Testing & Validation

## Description
Comprehensive testing and validation of the VLM adversarial patch finder system to ensure effectiveness, reliability, and performance meet requirements for exhibition deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Patch effectiveness test achieves >70% attack success rate
- [ ] 8-hour continuous reliability test completed successfully
- [ ] Performance metrics measured and documented
- [ ] All attack scenarios validated to work correctly
- [ ] System stability under load confirmed
- [ ] Edge cases and error conditions handled properly

## Technical Details
- Implement comprehensive test suite covering all attack vectors
- Set up automated testing framework for patch effectiveness measurement
- Create performance benchmarking tools for system metrics
- Develop reliability testing harness for extended operation
- Document all test results and system performance characteristics

## Dependencies
- [ ] Core system implementation (Tasks 3-10)
- [ ] VLM integration and patch generation (Tasks 11-5)
- [ ] Attack execution system (Task 7)
