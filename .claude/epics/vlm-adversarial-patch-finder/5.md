# Task: Loss Functions

## Description
Create comprehensive loss functions for adversarial patch generation targeting Vision Language Models. This includes both targeted attacks (forcing specific misclassifications) and non-targeted attacks (object omission). The implementation will provide a pluggable interface allowing easy experimentation with different attack objectives.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement targeted attack loss function (force specific misclassification)
- [ ] Implement non-targeted attack loss function (object omission/suppression)
- [ ] Create pluggable loss function interface for extensibility
- [ ] Support confidence-based loss variants
- [ ] Implement loss function composition for multi-objective attacks
- [ ] Include gradient smoothing and regularization options
- [ ] Support batch processing of loss computations

## Technical Details
- Create abstract `LossFunction` base class with common interface
- Implement `TargetedLoss` for forcing specific model outputs
- Implement `NonTargetedLoss` for general object suppression
- Support confidence thresholds and margin-based losses
- Include regularization terms (patch smoothness, total variation)
- Implement loss function factory for easy configuration
- Optimize for GPU computation with PyTorch tensors

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3: VLM Integration Framework (model outputs and gradients)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with all loss function variants
- [ ] Tests written and passing for each loss type
- [ ] Documentation updated with mathematical formulations
- [ ] Code reviewed and performance validated
