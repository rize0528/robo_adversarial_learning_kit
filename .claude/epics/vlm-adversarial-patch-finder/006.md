# Task: Camera Integration - Capture frames, detect patches, process for VLM

## Description
Implement real-time camera integration system that captures video frames, detects adversarial patches using computer vision techniques, and processes frames for VLM inference. This creates the bridge between physical world capture and machine learning analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] OpenCV camera capture system implemented with configurable resolution/FPS
- [ ] Template matching algorithm for patch detection with confidence thresholds
- [ ] Frame preprocessing pipeline for VLM-compatible input format
- [ ] Real-time patch bounding box visualization overlay
- [ ] Frame buffering system for smooth processing pipeline
- [ ] Camera calibration utilities for accurate patch size estimation
- [ ] Error handling for camera disconnection/failure scenarios

## Technical Details
- Use OpenCV for camera interface and image processing
- Implement template matching with normalized cross-correlation
- Create frame preprocessing for consistent VLM input format
- Add configurable detection sensitivity parameters
- Include frame rate monitoring and performance metrics
- Support multiple camera backends (USB, IP cameras)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001: Core VLM inference engine must be complete
- [ ] OpenCV Python bindings installed
- [ ] Camera hardware available for testing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with proper error handling
- [ ] Tests written and passing for all camera operations
- [ ] Documentation updated with camera setup instructions
- [ ] Code reviewed for performance optimization
- [ ] Integration tested with VLM inference pipeline
