# Task: Patch Generation Script

## Description
Create a complete offline patch generation workflow that combines the optimization core and loss functions into a user-friendly script. This script will handle batch processing of training images, configuration management, and comprehensive logging of the patch generation process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create complete patch generation script with CLI interface
- [ ] Support batch processing of multiple training images
- [ ] Implement configuration file support (YAML/JSON)
- [ ] Save and load patches in standard formats (PNG, NPY)
- [ ] Generate comprehensive optimization logs and metrics
- [ ] Support resume functionality for interrupted optimization runs
- [ ] Include visualization of patch generation progress
- [ ] Provide example configuration files and usage documentation

## Technical Details
- Create main `generate_patches.py` script with argument parsing
- Implement batch processing with multiprocessing support
- Use configuration files for reproducible experiments
- Save optimization history (loss curves, intermediate patches)
- Include real-time progress visualization with matplotlib
- Implement patch evaluation metrics (success rate, imperceptibility)
- Support different output formats and directory structures
- Include experiment metadata and provenance tracking

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 11: Patch Optimization Core (optimization engine)
- [ ] Task 5: Loss Functions (attack objectives)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with complete workflow script
- [ ] Tests written and passing for batch processing
- [ ] Documentation updated with usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Code reviewed and end-to-end functionality validated
