# Stream A: Core Loss Function Framework

## Scope
Core infrastructure for adversarial patch loss functions. This includes the abstract LossFunction base class, loss function factory for configuration, GPU optimization setup with PyTorch tensors, and base regularization framework.

## Files
- `src/losses/base.py`
- `src/losses/__init__.py`
- `src/losses/factory.py`
- `tests/test_loss_base.py`

## Progress
- Starting core loss function framework implementation
- Focus on creating robust base infrastructure for all loss types
