# Task: Patch Optimization Core

## Description
Implement the core adversarial patch optimization engine using PyTorch. This component will handle gradient-based optimization for generating adversarial patches that can fool Vision Language Models (VLMs). The implementation will include support for various optimization algorithms and Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) to create robust patches.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement PyTorch-based adversarial patch optimization loop
- [ ] Support gradient ascent and descent optimization methods
- [ ] Implement Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) for robust patch generation
- [ ] Support configurable optimization parameters (learning rate, iterations, etc.)
- [ ] Implement patch constraint handling (pixel value bounds, smoothness)
- [ ] Support different initialization strategies for patches
- [ ] Include optimization progress tracking and logging

## Technical Details
- Create `PatchOptimizer` class with PyTorch backend
- Implement EOT by averaging gradients over multiple transformations
- Support both targeted and non-targeted optimization objectives
- Include patch regularization techniques (smoothness, total variation)
- Implement checkpointing for long optimization runs
- Use GPU acceleration when available

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3: VLM Integration Framework (model loading and inference)
- [ ] Task 10: Image Processing Pipeline (transformations and preprocessing)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with full PyTorch optimization loop
- [ ] Tests written and passing for optimization components
- [ ] Documentation updated with usage examples
- [ ] Code reviewed and meets performance requirements
