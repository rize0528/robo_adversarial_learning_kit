# Task: Demo Interface - Build Gradio app with attack scenarios and visualizations

## Description
Create an interactive Gradio web application that demonstrates adversarial patch attacks on vision-language models. The interface will provide side-by-side comparisons of normal vs attacked outputs, scenario selection, and real-time impact visualization for educational and research purposes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Gradio web interface with intuitive navigation and responsive design
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison view showing original vs attacked VLM outputs
- [ ] Interactive scenario selector with predefined attack configurations
- [ ] Real-time impact dashboard with confidence scores and attack metrics
- [ ] Image upload functionality for custom attack testing
- [ ] Live camera feed integration for real-time demonstration
- [ ] Export functionality for results and generated reports
- [ ] Educational tooltips explaining attack mechanisms and impacts

## Technical Details
- Build using Gradio framework for rapid prototyping and deployment
- Implement responsive layout with tabbed interface for different scenarios
- Create real-time visualization components for attack success metrics
- Add interactive controls for patch parameters (size, position, opacity)
- Include batch processing capability for multiple test images
- Implement result caching for improved performance
- Add logging system for demonstration sessions and user interactions

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3: Core VLM inference engine operational
- [ ] Task 8: Camera integration system functional
- [ ] Gradio framework installed and configured
- [ ] Web assets and styling components prepared

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with modular component architecture
- [ ] Tests written and passing for all interface components
- [ ] Documentation updated with deployment and usage instructions
- [ ] Code reviewed for security and usability
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed with real scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimized for smooth real-time operation
