# Stream A: Image Processing Foundation

## Scope
Image processing foundation for adversarial patch generation data pipeline. This includes image loading utilities for common formats, preprocessing pipeline with resize/normalize/tensor conversion, VLM-specific preprocessing requirements, and data augmentation capabilities.

## Files
- `src/data/preprocessing.py`
- `src/utils/image_utils.py` (extending existing)
- `tests/test_preprocessing.py`
- Sample test images

## Progress
- Starting image processing foundation implementation
- Focus on creating robust image loading and preprocessing utilities
