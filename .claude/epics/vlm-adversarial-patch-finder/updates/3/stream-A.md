## Dependencies Ready for Stream B

The environment is now fully prepared for Stream B (VLM Model Integration):

✅ **PyTorch 2.8.0** with MPS acceleration ready  
✅ **Transformers 4.51.3** ready for Gemma model loading  
✅ **HuggingFace Hub** configured for model downloads  
✅ **OpenCV 4.12.0** ready for image preprocessing  
✅ **Configuration files** optimized for the target system  
✅ **Comprehensive testing** validates all components  

## Next Steps for Stream B

Stream B (VLM Model Integration) can now proceed with:
1. Gemma-3 model loading using the configured environment
2. Basic inference pipeline implementation  
3. Model performance validation
4. Integration with the configuration system

## Acceptance Criteria Status
